# Scratch

Hi. I'm a starter theme generator called <code>Scratch</code> based on <code>_s</code> and <code>Foundation</code>. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a <em>Parent Theme</em>. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

## Getting Started

If you need it, install Yeoman through npm:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-scratch clone this repository, enter the directory, and link it to npm:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:sixteenbit/generator-scratch.git && cd generator-scratch
$ npm link
```

Finally, in the desired project directory, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo scratch
```

## Theme details

- Bower to manage front-end dependencies
- NPM to manage development dependencies (like Grunt)
- Grunt to streamline development
