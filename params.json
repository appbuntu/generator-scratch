  "body": "## About\r\n\r\nScratch is a starter theme generator based on <code>_s</code> and <code>Foundation</code>. It's a theme meant for hacking so don't use it as a <em>Parent Theme</em>. Instead try turning it into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n#### Install Yeoman\r\n\r\n    npm install -g yo\r\n    \r\n#### Install Grunt.js\r\n\r\n    npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n\r\n#### Install Bower\r\n\r\n    npm install -g bower\r\n\r\n#### Install generator-scratch\r\n\r\n    npm install -g generator-scratch\r\n\r\nLot's of code will happen. This may take a few minutes. Go make a beverage! When it's done you can use the generator like so... Navigate to your development WordPress theme folder [change path as needed]:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/Sites/Development/Wordpress/wp-content/themes\r\n\r\nRun the generator\r\n\r\n    yo scratch\r\n\r\nYou will be prompted with a few basic questions to help the setup get started. Once you get past the description question you will again see lots of code. That's grunt and bower doing their thing. It's also time to drink your beverage!\r\n\r\nNavigate to your new theme:\r\n\r\n    cd newtheme\r\n    \r\nIn the root of your theme, run the following:\r\n\r\n`npm i && bower i`\r\n\r\nThen run `grunt` to build the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nIn your wp-content/themes folder you will now have a folder with the name of your theme which is setup with the basics to get a theme off the ground quickly. In the root of your newly created theme you'll have the following grunt tasks you can run:\r\n\r\nCopies foundation dev files from bower to dev directory\r\n    \r\n    grunt setup\r\n    \r\nRuns the default task that builds the assets\r\n    \r\n    grunt\r\n\r\nInitiates Browsersync and watches files for changes\r\n    \r\n    grunt server\r\n\r\n## Production\r\n\r\nWhen you're done and ready to go live you'll need to minify your assets and whatnot. You can do this by using:\r\n\r\n    grunt build\r\n    \r\nThis will minify all your assets and copy the theme to a dist/ directory then compresses to a .zip.\r\n\r\n### Theme structure\r\n\r\n- /assets/sass/ - Development Sass files that is compiled into assets/css/main.css.\r\n- /assets/js/src/ - Development js that is concatenated to /assets/js/.\r\n- style.css - names and sets up your theme as far as WordPress is concerned.\r\nfunctions.php - your theme functions\r\n- *.php your theme files\r\n\r\n\r\n    themename\r\n    |\r\n    |-assets\r\n    | |-css\r\n    | |-img\r\n    | |-js\r\n    | |-sass\r\n    |   |-layout\r\n    |   |-mixins\r\n    |   |-modules\r\n    |   |-sections\r\n    |   |-shared\r\n    |   |-variables\r\n    |\r\n    |-components\r\n    | |-header\r\n    | |-navigation\r\n    | |-page\r\n    | |-post\r\n    |\r\n    |-grunt\r\n    |\r\n    |-inc\r\n    |\r\n    |-languages\r\n    |\r\n    |*.php\r\n    |style.css\r\n",
